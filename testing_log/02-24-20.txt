Starting the process of switching from MaxIM DL API to ASCOM API.  First step was to figure out what the ASCOM driver is called,
to replace win32com.client.Dispatch("MaxIM.CCDCamera") with win32com.client.Dispatch("ASCOM.[something]").

From the MINERVA code, this looked like it would help with just that:

import win32com.client

x = win32com.client.Dispatch("ASCOM.Utilities.Chooser")
x.DeviceType = "Camera"
driver = x.Choose(None)
print("The driver is" + driver)


When running, though, I get a window called "ASCOM Camera Chooser" where I have to choose what camera driver to use, but my only options are
"Camera V2 Simulator" and "Simulator."  I tried this after having connected to the camera through MaxIm, and still no luck.  I tried reinstalling
the SBIG camera drivers from Diffraction Limited, and stil nothing.  Tried looking through other ASCOM programs and setups, nothing.  After some
research, I found some people claiming that SBIG cameras don't have any ASCOM drivers?  Some claim there is a software development kit we can
use?  When doing the setup through MaxIm, there is an option for SBIG Universal cameras or ASCOM cameras, and the ASCOM option launches the
same "driver chooser" window that the code does.  The SBIG option, however, opens a separate setup window all together.

Also still couldn't get the saving to work with Maxim API.  Adding the image name didn't help.  I tried with .fit and .fits, and without the file
extension.  I also tried without the file name, and without the "r" for raw, which requires 2 backslashes for each backslash.  Tried different
directories too, but nothing worked.  MaxIm can save images just fine normally, so I'm not sure what's going on.
