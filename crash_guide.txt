OUTDATED
If the code crashes:

Kill git bash
Open a new git bash (search in Windows)
Run "cd ~/-omegalambda" [or press up arrow until you see it]
Run "python -u -m main.drivers.driver" [or press up arrow until you see it]

This will work as long as your observation ticket is properly coded within main.drivers.driver - temporary solution until we have a cli up and running that will make than an argument.
